# RhythmSuite
Rhythm Suite is an osu-like hub for my original rhythm game ideas. Currently there is only one gamemode, SineWave.

This idea started development in late 2022 and made its first release in May 2023. With 50 charts, online leaderboards, adjustable rates, a practice mode, and a chart editor, Rhythm Suite can provide hundreds of hours of fun.

To build, simply run make. View requirements.txt for a list of dependencies.
